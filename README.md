This project is a google chrome extension that will allow the user to upload photos to the extension. One of those photos will then randomly be displayed as a background each time the user opens a new tab.

If the user wants the refresher on how to use this extension they can click the Usage button, located around the top left corner for a popup containing a brief explanation on how to use this extension.

To submit photos to the extension all the user needs to do is click on the choose file button, choose the desired file, and press open to upload it. Alternately, they can simply drag their photo over the choose file file button and drop it there where it will automatically upload. The new background will have a chance of being displayed, depending on how many backgrounds there are, upon the page being refreshed or a new tab being opened. The input will be able to render any file type the css background-image property can, including PNGs, SVGs, JPGs, GIFs, and WEBPs. In the event of a successful addition the browser will inform the user. The extension had a single preset background but upon the first upload it will not come up again.

To remove photos one can simply press the remove button, located just under the choose files button, to remove the background currently being displayed. In the event of a successful removal the browser will inform the user. The old background will stay until the page is refreshed or a new tab is opened.

At the bottom a group of shortcut buttons are located. Pressing any of them will immediately take the user to the website specified on the button. Ex: The youtube button, upon being pressed will take the user to youtube.com.

In the top right corner, the history button is located. Hovering over the history button will reveal a drop down menu detailing the nine most recently visited sites or searches. The list also acts as links and upon clicking one of the searches or sites the user will be forwarded to it

Other features of the main background page include the time and date in the far left corner, continuously updating in real time, and the google search bar, located in the top middle which allows the user to search google by typing in their query and pressing ‘Enter’.

Beyond the main page, clicking on the extension icon in the top right corner of the browser, along with the other extensions will reveal a popup containing various small javascript games that can be played alone or with friends.

There are five buttons, four leading to javascript games in that same popup, and one leading to an external website, jadencohen.com, containing a collaborative canvas inspired by Reddit’s r/place. 

The first game, bumper balls, is a two player game in which the players are balls and they take turns chasing each other down, trying to force collisions. The more collisions forced, the more points one gains. Then the turns change and the formerly chased player turns to chase. 

The second game, Scuffed Pong, is a two player game inspired by pong, but with a much more random spin on it. Like in traditional pong, the ball will bounce back and forth between the users’ paddles which can move up and down. But the ball can also bounce off of walls and the speed and angle will change randomly with every collision with a paddle. Each time the ball collides with a paddle, the user controlling the paddle gets a point. The one with the most points at the end wins.

The third game, Guess the Number, is very simple. The user must guess a number between 1 and 1,000,000 in as few guesses as possible. The game will inform the user if they need to go higher or lower and will display to them their last three guesses. At the end it will display to the user the total amount of guesses it took the user. It will also store the users record and inform them whenever they’ve broken it.

The fourth and final game is the Matchstick Game. This is a two player game in which the objective is to pick up the last matchstick. At the beginning, the players will agree on and input the total number of matches and the maximum number of matches that can be picked in one turn. Then the player will take turns picking up one to the previously decided maximum. Whoever picks the last match wins.
